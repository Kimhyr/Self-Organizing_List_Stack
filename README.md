# Self-Organizing List Stack

A DSA for a compiler's [symbol table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table).

The DSA is really just a version of a [self-organizing
list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_list) except each list
(node) can stack on top of each other to represent scopes.
